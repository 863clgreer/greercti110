## About me
- I love painting and sketching because it helps me express myself creatively and relax after a busy day.
- I’m naturally curious and love asking questions about how things work—especially in science and history.
- I’ve read the Harry Potter series six times and can quote most of the spells by heart!
- In my free time, I enjoy baking cookies and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
- One day, I’d like to travel the world and experience as many cultures and cuisines as possible.
## My favorite songs
- [Music Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&t=1s) - Rickrolling is great because it’s a hilarious way to spread unexpected joy and nostalgia with an iconic bop!
- [Wicked "What is this Feeling"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amgPXKrFZVg) - “What Is This Feeling?” from Wicked is a perfect blend of humor, drama, and clever lyricism, making it unforgettable and ridiculously fun to sing along to!
- [Michael in the Bathroom, from Be More Chill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj1P-5Ey4dU) - “Michael in the Bathroom” is a raw, heartbreaking masterpiece that captures the loneliness and vulnerability of feeling out of place, all wrapped in an emotionally powerful performance.
- [The Room Where it Happens, Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WySzEXKUSZw) - “The Room Where It Happens” is a dazzling showstopper that perfectly captures ambition, power, and intrigue, with unforgettable energy and a groove that stays in your head for days.
